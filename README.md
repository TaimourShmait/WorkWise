# WorkWise

WorkWise is an AI-assisted project management workspace for small development teams. It brings project planning, sprint execution, kanban task tracking, documentation, notifications, and AI-generated planning support into one full-stack application.

> **Note:** This is a fork of a team project built during an internship at Aspire GDC by a team of three developers, shared with permission.

## My Contributions
I worked across the backend, frontend, and data model, with a focus on sprint delivery and AI features:

- **AI planning features** — task breakdown, acceptance-criteria generation, natural-language task search, sprint suggestions, sprint risk analysis, and retrospective generation (Google Gemini integration: prompt design, response parsing, validation, and rate limiting)
- **Sprint planning & delivery analytics** — sprint capacity planning and velocity-based forecasting
- **Custom workflow statuses** — refactored task status from a fixed enum into user-definable, per-project workflow statuses with status categories, migrating the existing data model across the app (board, sprints, analytics, AI)
- **Task hierarchy & estimation** — Jira-style parent/child subtasks and task types, replacing time-based estimates with Fibonacci story points across the codebase
- **Account & settings** — password change, email change with verification, per-project notification preferences
- **Attachment storage** — migrated file attachments from database blobs to Supabase object storage

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React, Vite, TypeScript, React Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL, typically hosted on Supabase |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Realtime | Socket.io |
| AI | Google Gemini via `@google/genai` |
| Auth | JWT access and refresh tokens, bcrypt password hashing |
| Email | SMTP with optional Resend fallback |
| Testing | Vitest, Testing Library, Supertest |
| Hosting | Vercel for frontend, Render for backend |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Git
- A PostgreSQL database, such as Supabase
- Optional: Google Gemini API key for AI features
- Optional: SMTP or Resend credentials for password reset and invitation emails

## Local Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies separately for the client and server.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd WorkWise

npm install --prefix client
npm install --prefix server
```

Create environment files from the examples.

```bash
cp client/.env.example client/.env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit the copied `.env` files with local or development credentials. Do not commit real secrets.

Run Prisma generation and migrations from the server directory.

```bash
cd server
npx prisma generate
npm run db:migrate
```

Start the backend and frontend in separate terminals.

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Default local URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: http://localhost:<PORT> (defaults to 5000 unless overridden).

## Environment Variables

### Client

Defined in [client/.env.example](client/.env.example).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Yes | Backend API origin used by the Vite frontend, for example `http://localhost:3000` or a Render URL. |

Only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to browser code.

### Server

Defined in [server/.env.example](server/.env.example).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Runtime PostgreSQL connection string. For Supabase pooler transaction mode, include `?pgbouncer=true`. |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Yes | Direct/session PostgreSQL connection string used by Prisma migrations and generation. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for signing access tokens. |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for signing refresh tokens. Use a different value from `JWT_SECRET`. |
| `PORT` | No | Express server port. Render provides this automatically in production. |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Runtime environment, usually `development` or `production`. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | No | Allowed CORS origin and frontend URL used in email links. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Required for AI | Google Gemini API key for AI generation features. |
| `DAILY_DIGEST_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | No | Enables scheduled daily digest generation when set for the scheduler. |
| `DAILY_DIGEST_HOUR_UTC` | No | UTC hour used by the daily digest scheduler. |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `MAIL_FROM` | Required for SMTP email | SMTP credentials and sender metadata for password reset and invitations. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Optional | Optional transactional email fallback. |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Optional | Supabase API values if direct Supabase REST/Auth calls are added or enabled. |

## Git Workflow

This project uses a two-branch model with `main` and `develop`.

- `main`: production-ready code.
- `develop`: active development branch.
- Feature branches should use the Jira ticket number, for example `feature/SCRUM-179-project-documentation`.
- Open pull requests into `develop` and keep branches focused on one task.

## Development Notes

- All protected HTTP endpoints expect `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`.
- Socket.io clients authenticate with the same access token in `handshake.auth.token`.
- The backend CORS origin is controlled by `FRONTEND_URL`.
- Prisma uses `DATABASE_URL` at runtime and `DIRECT_URL` for migrations.
- Keep generated secrets, API keys, database passwords, and SMTP credentials out of git.
